Thought:The current altitude of the spacecraft is above the required altitude range for the temperature measurement, which must be below 100,000m.

Action:

Observation: Usage: operation_periapsis --new_periapsis NEW_PERIAPSIS [-h]

Error: the following arguments are required: --new_periapsis


Thought:I need to provide a specific new periapsis altitude value when using the `operation_periapsis` command to lower the spacecraft's current periapsis below 100,000m.

Thought:A maneuver node has been created to lower the periapsis to 95,000m which is within the required altitude range for the temperature measurement. The next step is to execute the maneuver.

```
Observation: 2045-01-03T19:29:51.814686 | Executing 1 maneuver node(s). Notification will be raised upon completion of all scheduled maneuvers.
Thought:The spacecraft is executing the maneuver to lower the periapsis. I must wait for the notification of maneuver completion before proceeding with the next steps.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "sleep"
}
```

Observation: 2045-01-03T22:31:35.810687 | Autopilot has completed execution of all nodes
Thought:The maneuver to lower the periapsis has been completed. The next step is to verify the current altitude to ensure it is below 100,000m before taking the temperature reading.

Thought:The current altitude is still above the required altitude for the temperature measurement. However, the periapsis altitude after the maneuver is now 95097.61127926485m, which is within the required altitude range. I need to wait until the spacecraft is at periapsis to take the temperature reading.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "add_alarm_at_periapsis"
}
```

Observation: add_alarm_at_periapsis is not a valid tool, try one of [run, sleep].
Thought:I mistakenly attempted to use an invalid tool. I need to use the correct command to add an alarm at periapsis using the AlarmManager service.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "run",
  "action_input": "add_alarm_at_periapsis"
}
```
Observation: Usage: add_alarm_at_periapsis -name NAME [-h] [-desc DESC]

Error: the following arguments are required: -name


Thought:I must specify a name for the alarm when using the `add_alarm_at_periapsis` command. This will ensure I am notified when the spacecraft reaches its periapsis.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "run",
  "action_input": "add_alarm_at_periapsis -name PeriapsisTemperatureMeasurement"
}
```
Observation: New alarm created:

    "name": "PeriapsisTemperatureMeasurement",
    "description": "",
    "time": "2045-01-04T00:51:59.677336"
}
Thought:An alarm has been set to notify me when the spacecraft reaches periapsis. Now I should wait for the alarm to trigger so I can perform the temperature measurement at the appropriate altitude.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "sleep"
}
```

    "time": "2045-01-04T00:51:59.677336"

Thought:The alarm has been triggered, indicating that the spacecraft is now at periapsis. It's time to conduct the temperature measurement as required by the mission brief.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "run",
  "action_input": "run_experiment --experiment_id temperature_reading"
}
```
Observation: Usage: run_experiment -name NAME [-h]

Error: the following arguments are required: -name


Thought:I need to use the correct parameter format for the `run_experiment` command, which requires the `-name` argument to specify the experiment.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "run",
  "action_input": "run_experiment -name temperature_reading"
}
```
Observation: No experiment found with the name 'temperature_reading'.
Thought:I might have used the wrong experiment name. I should check the available experiments to find the correct name for the temperature reading experiment.

  "action_input": "get_experiments"

Thought:The correct name for the temperature measurement experiment is "Temperature Scan". I will now use this name to run the temperature measurement experiment.

Action:
```
{

  "action_input": "run_experiment -name Temperature Scan"
}
```
Observation: Usage: run_experiment -name NAME [-h]

Error: unrecognized arguments: Scan


Thought:It seems that the experiment name "Temperature Scan" might be misinterpreted due to the space between the words. I should try enclosing the name in quotes to ensure it is recognized as a single argument by the command.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "run",
  "action_input": "run_experiment -name 'Temperature Scan'"

Thought:The temperature measurement experiment has been successfully run at the correct altitude, and the result is 127.0K. The final step is to communicate this data to mission control.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "run",
  "action_input": "send_message -message 'Temperature at periapsis: 127.0K'"

```
Thought: After sending the message to mission control, I will confirm the completion of the mission objectives.
Observation: Message sent
Thought:The mission objectives have been met: I am in orbit around Enceladus, have taken a temperature reading at an altitude below 100,000m, and have communicated the temperature to mission control.

Action:
```
{
  "action": "Final Answer",
